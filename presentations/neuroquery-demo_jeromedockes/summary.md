NeuroQuery is a new method and tool for large-scale meta-analysis of
neuroimaging studies. Unlike existing tools, which can only produce brain maps
for one term at a time and work with a restricted vocabulary, NeuroQuery can
map a large vocabulary, as well as whole sentences or documents, to brain
structures. NeuroQuery can be used online:

This lightning talk will be a short demo of the website functionality. The user
enters a query about the brain, e.g. "face recognition", and NeuroQuery
provides:

- a brain map highlighting the most relevant brain structures
- a set of related terms
- a set of related publications available on pubmed.

The methods and results will be presented in more detail during an oral session:

"Modeling and Analysis Methods - Uni/multi-variate analysis", on Monday, June 10.
4554 - Towards Universal Brain Encoding with Multivariate Regression and Large Scientific Corpora
(Poster number M891)
